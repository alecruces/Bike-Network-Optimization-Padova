# Data Driven Prediction of Missing Links in Padova's Bike Lane Network

This project is part of my Masterâ€™s thesis for Data Science.

## Abstract
Cycling infrastructure is crucial for urban mobility, yet many cities struggle to meet the increasing demand for well-connected bike paths. This research focuses on Padova, Italy, proposing a data-driven method to identify and prioritize new bike routes. By integrating data from the RideMovi bike-sharing system and modifying traditional centrality measures, a novel weighted benefit metric is introduced. Grounded in stress centrality, this metric considers both cyclist demand and the strategic importance of network components to prioritize infrastructure improvements effectively.

The analysis reveals that central areas of Padova, especially around the train station and city center, require substantial upgrades. Key routes connecting the university and hospital are prioritized, while peripheral areas are considered lower priority. This study provides actionable recommendations for enhancing bike network connectivity in high-demand zones. The Component approach identifies broad infrastructure gaps, while the Routing approach offers a more efficient solution by adding fewer kilometers of new paths, better aligning with actual cyclist demand.
